## VWorks file repository for SciLifeLab

### Description
This repository contains files for *VWorks Automation Control* used to control the *Agilent NGS Workstation*. These protocols and supporting files are neccessary to run the automated laboratory protocols used at the Genomics platform at Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm.

The repository is a way to backup, track versions and share these protocols through a easily accessible resource. The repo is maintained by [Joel Gruselius](mailto:joel.gruselius@scilifelab.se).

#### Versions
There are two main branches of the repository:
- *master* &mdash; contains all files including protocols under development
- *production* &mdash; only maintains validated protocols.

### Installation
Clone the desired branch of the repository and place the files and folders of the resulting <code>bravo-protocols/</code> into <code>VWorks Workspace/</code>. Note that for many protocols the appropriate device files are required under <code>VWorks Workspace/Device Files/</code>. Also, the associated labware and liquid class entries are required in the Windows registry.
