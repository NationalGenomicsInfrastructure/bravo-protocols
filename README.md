## VWorks file repository for SciLifeLab

### Description
This repository contains files for *VWorks Automation Control* used to control the *Agilent NGS Workstation*. These protocols and supporting files are neccessary to run the automated laboratory protocols used at the Genomics platform at Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm.

The repository provides means to backup, track versions and share these protocols through a easily accessible resource. The repo is maintained by [Joel Gruselius](mailto:joel.gruselius@scilifelab.se).

#### Versions
Previosly there was a `master` and a `production` branch, the first containing all protocols including things in development and the latter was supposed to only hold validated protocols. This has changed so that the main three branches correspond to the different configurations of the robots which makes more sense:
- *marvin* &mdash; This is an Agilent NGS Workstation Option B setup (Bravo + BenchCel + MiniHub) and also contains many in-development protocols.
- *bender* &mdash; This is a custom configuration consisting of the Option B plus the following equipment (only some protocols utilize these and must be modified if to be run on a standard Option B setup):
	- BenchBot robot arm
	- Xpeel
	- Centrifuge
	- tRobot thermal cycler
	- PlateLoc sealer
- *hal* &mdash; This system is a standalone Bravo (Option A but with things moved around a little bit).

### Installation
Clone the desired branch of the repository and place the files and folders of the resulting `bravo-protocols/` into `VWorks Workspace/`. Note that for many protocols the appropriate device files are required under `VWorks Workspace/Device Files/`. Also, the associated labware and liquid class entries are required in the Windows registry.
